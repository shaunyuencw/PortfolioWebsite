    title: 'Self-Supervised Learning in Computer Vision',
    description: "I applied self-supervised learning techniques to improve performance in computer vision tasks, resulting in an 18% improvement with just 100 labels per class compared to traditional supervised techniques and a 5% improvement with 1000 labels per class. We also used self-supervised learning for anomaly detection by clustering bad training images. This work has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of labeled data required for training and improve the quality of machine learning models.",
